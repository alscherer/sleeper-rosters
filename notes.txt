How to:

1. Get player pool
	https://api.sleeper.app/v1/players/nfl/
	- save page as json file
	- don't try to highlight entire file and "insert" into new json - will take forever

2. translate player pool to json
	- parse_players.pl <player pool json file>

2. Get owners
	get_users.py -> today, league ID hard-coded in py. change to having league id in an input file that every app can use. 

3. Get draft schedule
	schedule & draft ID: https://api.sleeper.app/v1/league/<league_id>/drafts
	xfl 2022 league id 787796366440124416
	xfl 2022 draft id 787796366440124417 -> gives draft info https://api.sleeper.app/v1/draft/787796366440124417
	
4. Draft/Keeper results
	draft results https://api.sleeper.app/v1/draft/787796366440124417/picks
	--> I used this for keepers - save as json
	

4. Get rosters
 	-- Source URL = https://api.sleeper.app/v1/league/650130288072040448/rosters
 	-- Put the URL in the py file, run get_rosters.py & save to json file

5. Get transactions
	App will Download & parse all weekly transactions from
         https://api.sleeper.app/v1/league/787796366440124416/transactions/<week #>
    & save to a json file.
	Set URL in app then Run get_transactions.

6. Merge draft + transactions
    TODO!!!

6. Merge users, players & roster data 
	merge_teams_and_rosters.py -o <writeable file for current rosters>

7. Combine transactions
